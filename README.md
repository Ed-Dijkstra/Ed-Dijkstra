👋 Hi, I’m @Ed-Dijkstra. I'm a game design student situated in the Netherlands.

👀 I’m interested in ...
- Role-playing games (Tabletop or Video games)
- Fantasy or Sci-fi storytelling (in books or any form of media)
- Strategy and tactics
- Video game and movie music

🎮 I'm currently playing ...
- Stellaris
- Dark Souls: Remastered
- Factorio
- D&D (not currently in a group, but busy worldbuilding)

🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Unity
- Blender
- General game design
- Few daily minutes of DuoLingo (Japanese)
I'm always looking for ways to develop other skills (2d art, creative writing, sound design) but not currently working on anything.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
Anything that fits my interests and schedule. Feel free to reach out!
